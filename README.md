This repository contains the materials and structure for the AI literacy learning path, designed to accompany the paper entitled <strong>"A Structured Unplugged Approach for Foundational AI Literacy in Primary Education"</strong>. 
Given that the activities were delivered to children, all materials were currently in the local language. To enable reproducibility, we provide here the English version.

## ðŸ“Œ Learning Path Structure
<p align="justify">
Our structured learning path, divided into <strong>four modules</strong>, aims at introducing primary school students to key AI concepts while integrating foundational mathematical reasoning. 
Grounded in <strong>constructivism</strong>, <strong>constructionism</strong>, and <strong>spiral learning</strong>, the approach progressively builds students' understanding by reinforcing prior knowledge and introducing new representational models.
Using <strong>learning-by-doing</strong> and <strong>learning-by-necessity</strong> methodologies, students actively engage in experimentation and problem-solving.
</p>

### **Module 1: Introduction to AI** (2 hours)
<p align="justify">
This module introduces students to the foundations of <strong>CS</strong> and <strong>AI</strong>, leading to how AI processes data through human-defined rules. Students explore real-world examples of <strong>computer perception</strong> and engage in <strong>hands-on semi-guided explorations</strong> to understand key concepts such as <strong>data labeling</strong>, <strong>training</strong>, and <strong>model evaluation</strong>. The module emphasizes AIâ€™s limitations, helping students recognize that AI systems follow structured input-output rules rather than independent thinking.

### **Module 2: Classification Principles** (2 hours)
<p align="justify">
This module focuses on <strong>classification</strong>, teaching students how AI categorizes objects using predefined rules derived from data. Through hands-on activities, like classifying a fictional <strong>Monster family</strong>, students learn to identify features, develop rule-based models, and evaluate their accuracy. The session highlights challenges such as <strong>overfitting</strong> and emphasizes how AI classification systems require data-driven refinement for real-world applications.

### **Module 3: Classification Representations** (2 hours)
<p align="justify">
This module explores <strong>structured classification</strong>, teaching students how AI models use rule-based decision-making to categorize objects. Through examples like classifying <strong>photos</strong> and <strong>fish species</strong>, students practice using multiple representational models, including <strong>Euler-Venn diagrams</strong>, <strong>tables</strong>, and <strong>decision trees</strong>. Hands-on activities reinforce classification principles, helping students understand the strengths and limitations of different models while reflecting on real-world implications.

### **Module 4: Final Assessment & Reflection** (2 hours)
<p align="justify">
This final module focuses on evaluating studentsâ€™ <strong>learning outcomes</strong> and gathering feedback on their experience. A <strong>satisfaction questionnaire</strong> assesses student engagement, enjoyment, and perceived difficulty, while open-ended questions capture qualitative insights. To measure learning effectiveness, a <strong>post-test</strong> with seven exercises evaluates studentsâ€™ understanding of <strong>AI concepts</strong>, <strong>classification reasoning</strong>, and <strong>mathematical skills</strong>.
