# Foundational AI Literacy in Primary Education
<p align="justify">
This repository contains the materials and structure for the AI literacy learning path, designed to accompany the paper entitled <strong>"A Structured Unplugged Approach for Foundational AI Literacy in Primary Education"</strong> submitted for evaluation to <strong>AIED 2025</strong>. 
Given that the activities were delivered to children, all materials are currently in the local language. Upon acceptance of the paper, we will also provide an English version.

## ðŸ“Œ Learning Path Structure
<p align="justify">
Our structured learning path, divided into **four modules**, aimed at introducing primary school students to key AI concepts while integrating foundational mathematical reasoning. 
Grounded in **constructivism**, **constructionism**, and **spiral learning**, the approach progressively builds students' understanding by reinforcing prior knowledge and introducing new representational models.
Using **learning-by-doing** and **learning-by-necessity** methodologies, students actively engage in experimentation and problem-solving. 
</p>

### **Module 1: Introduction to AI** (2 hours)
This module introduces students to basic AI concepts, distinguishing AI from human intelligence and emphasizing **data processing and rule-based decision-making**. 
Students explore how computers perceive the world through data, learn the difference between data and information, and analyze examples like supermarket checkout systems and irrigation systems. 
They also engage with the "AI for the Oceans" activity to understand machine learning basics, including training and testing models.

### **Module 2: Classification Principles** (2 hours)
This module focuses on **classification reasoning**, guiding students on how AI systems categorize objects based on data features. Through hands-on activities, students classify fictional monsters using observable attributes, refine their classification strategies, and explore the importance of multiple features in decision-making. They also learn about overfitting by testing their classification models on new data.

### **Module 3: Classification Representations** (2 hours)
In this module, students expand on classification concepts by learning about various **representation models**. They use Euler-Venn diagrams, tables, and decision trees to represent classification processes. Activities include classifying mushrooms based on features and navigating a floor-based decision tree to reinforce logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.

### **Module 4: Final Assessment & Reflection** (2 hours)
The final module is dedicated to evaluating students' learning outcomes and gathering feedback on their overall experience. It includes a **post-test** to assess understanding of AI and mathematical concepts, and a **satisfaction questionnaire** to capture students' engagement and perceptions of the learning path.
